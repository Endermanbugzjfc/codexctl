# Codexctl
A utility program that helps to manage the remarkable device version utilizing [ddvks update server](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-update) 


## PLEASE READ BEFORE USING
If your remarkable device is at version >= 3.11, codexctl will not be able to automatically install updates on it due to a major overhaul in the update engine. You can still use the other functions like downloading the image files and then manually extracting it, using `dd` to write to the other partition and then using the `restore` command. More information can be found in https://github.com/Jayy001/codexctl/issues/71#issuecomment-2099115757.

### Installation & Use

You can find pre-compiled binaries on the [releases](https://github.com/Jayy001/codexctl/releases/) page. This includes a build for the reMarkable itself, as well as well as builds for linux, macOS, and Windows. It currently only has support for **command line interfaces** but a graphical interface is soon to come.

## Running from source

Codexctl can be run from source on both the reMarkable, as well as on a remote device.

### Running on reMarkable

```
git clone https://github.com/Jayy001/codexctl.git
cd codexctl
pip install -r requirements.txt
python codexctl.py --help
```

### Running on a remote device

This requires python 3.11 or newer.

```
git clone https://github.com/Jayy001/codexctl.git
cd codexctl
pip install wheel
pip install -r requirements.remote.txt
python codexctl.py --help
```

## Building executables from source

This requires python 3.11 or newer, python-venv, pip. Linux also requires libfuse-dev.

```
make executable
```

## Usage

The script is designed to have as little interactivity as possible, meaning arguments are directly taken from the command to run the script.

# Examples
```
codexctl install latest # Downloads and installs latest version
codexctl download toltec # Downloads latest version that has full support for toltec
codexctl download 3.0.4.1305 --rm1 # Downloads 3.0.4.1305 firmware file for remarkable 1
codexctl status # Prints current & previous version (can only be used when running on device itself)
codexctl list # Lists all available versions 
python codexctl.py restore # Restores previous version
python codexctl.py --verbose # Enables logging
python codexctl.py --backup # Exports all files to local directory
python codexctl.py --backup -l root -r FM --no-recursion --no-overwrite # Exports all files from FM directory to root folder on localhost
python codexctl.py extract 3.8.0.1944_reMarkable2-7eGpAv7sYB.signed # Extracts contents to filesystem named "extracted"
python codexctl.py mount extracted /opt/remarkable # Mounts extracted filesystem to /opt/remarkable
python codexctl.py ls 3.8.0.1944_reMarkable2-7eGpAv7sYB.signed / # Lists the root directory of the update image
python codexctl.py cat 3.8.0.1944_reMarkable2-7eGpAv7sYB.signed /etc/version # Outputs the contents of /etc/version from the update image
```
