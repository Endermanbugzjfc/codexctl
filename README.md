# Codexctl
A utility program that helps to manage the remarkable device version utilizing [ddvks update server](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-update) 

### Installation & Use

This program can be directly ran on the ReMarkable device as well as from a remote device such as your computer, it currently only has support for **command line interfaces** but a graphical interface is soon to come. The steps to install are closely similar apart from the couple of extra depedancies needed for running on a remote device. 

## Downloading compiled binaries
You can directly download the compiled binary from the [releases](https://github.com/Jayy001/codexctl/releases/) page. Just select your operating system & download the zip repo containing the binaries - then open up a terminal and run how you would from there. `./codexctl --help`

## Building from source

```
git clone https://github.com/Jayy001/codexctl.git
cd codexctl
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Thats it for running it directly on the remarkable. If you are running on a remote device you will need to use Python 3.8 or higher and run the following,

```
pip install wheel
pip install -r requirements.remote.txt
```


The script is designed to have as little interactivity as possible, meaning arguments are directly taken from the command to run the script.
